# Awesome Blockchain MCPs 🚀

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of **Blockchain & Crypto-related Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers**, enabling AI models to interact with Web3. MCP allows AI agents to safely execute on-chain actions, access blockchain data, and interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

## 🌍 What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) is an open standard that enables AI models to interact with external tools, including APIs, databases, and **blockchains**. It allows AI-powered applications to query blockchain data, perform on-chain transactions, and access crypto market data.

This list focuses on MCP servers **designed for the blockchain and crypto ecosystem**.
